# Daikibo Machine Failure Analysis (Forage Simulation)

This project was completed as part of the **Forage Virtual Job Simulation** with Daikibo Industrials.

## üîç Objective
Analyze machine telemetry data from 4 global factories to identify:
- Which location had the highest machine downtime?
- Which machines failed most often in that location?

## üìÅ Data
- JSON data (not included for confidentiality)
- Contains 1 month of 10-minute interval messages from 9 machine types at each factory.

## üß™ Methods Used
- JSON data parsing and filtering
- Aggregated breakdown counts
- Visualized insights (e.g. heatmaps, bar charts)

## üìä Tools
- Excel / Tableau / Python (specify what you used)

## üìå Key Findings
- The factory with the most frequent breakdowns was [insert location].
- The most failure-prone machine type was [insert machine type].
